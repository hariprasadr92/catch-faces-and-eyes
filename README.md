Computer Vision face and eye detection using haar cascade and Open CV

## About project 
This is a simple project that I created when I explored computer vision using Open CV. It used haar cascade for face and eyes data set.

You can use this project as a stand alone application ( program runs and records video from front cam ) or as a client-server model ( client records and sends []using TCP] video to server for processing). I tested it over WLAN. Explore futher if your requirements demand more.



## Pre-requisites and installation 

* You need python installed. 
* You cant install cv2 library. Instead install "opencv-python". Other dependancies should be easy to figure out.

* haarcascade.py - works stand alone

* server_haar - server file that listens
* Client.py - client program the records video


* The cam that needs to be used can be configured in OpenCV function.
* Check firewall settings for server if you use the project in the second way.
* client file should be run from command prompt. It might not by default work if u run it from pycharm or any editor.
